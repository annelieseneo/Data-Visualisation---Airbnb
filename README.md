Third Place Winner in Maven Vacation Challenge!

Who misses travelling? I know I do!

The perfect time for Maven Analytics and team to launch the Maven Vacation Challenge!

I am thrilled to explore Airbnb's real data of over 250k listings in the 10 cities that make up the world's most popular travel destinations, along with a staggering 5 mil reviews for 13 historical years. Need a jumpstart after putting a pin in all your travelling plans for far too long? My Tableau Software report, dashboard, and storyboard analyses many interesting patterns and trends in the global vacation rental market. Find your ideal destination with the best value for travel!
